New places, experiences, sometimes breathtaking. If you ask me how I like to relax, then my answer is here. On the bank of a mountain river, in an old small town, 3000 m above sea level, in the center of a metropolis, in a colorful forest, in a castle.... I have good news: this is an inexhaustible source of inspiration, and I every month (sometimes even more often) I go to some new places. This is the best vacation in the world."

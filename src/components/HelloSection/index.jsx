          I'm a front-end programmer and I made this site to make it easier for
          you to get to know me. I tried to make it simple, understandable and
          beautiful, so that our acquaintance would be as pleasant as possible.

          I suggest you start exploring from the ABOUT page, but you can always
          find what you need in the top menu.
